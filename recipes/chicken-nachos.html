    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is THE BEST chicken nacho recipe! What's not to love about crispy corn chips loaded with succulent chicken breast and melted cheese?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>15 oz. corn tortilla chips (1 large bag)</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>1 lime, zested and juiced </li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp crumbled queso fresco</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a rack to the center of your oven and preheat it to 400°F. Pound the chicken breast an inch thick with a heavy skillet. Sprinkle liberally on both sides with taco seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add cooking oil to a heavy-bottomed skillet set over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breast for 5 minutes, then flip it and cook for a few minutes more, or until a thermometer reads 165°F.</li>
        <li>Slice the jalapeño and two green onions. Chop the cilantro. Dice the avocado and drizzle lime juice over it to keep it from browning.</li>
        <li>When your chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F, remove it from the pan and let it rest for five minutes. Chop it into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Add half a bag of corn chips to the pan. Top with half of the shredded cheese and half of the chopped chicken.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process with the remaining chips, cheese, and chicken. Bake at 400°F until the cheese melts, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the nachos with the avocado, jalapeño, green onion, lime zest, and chopped cilantro. Finish with dollops of sour cream and sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco.</li>
    </ol>
